<h1>About</h1>
This plugin adds many custom items. Candy from a shady candy shop. Costumes from an even shadier costume shop. 
Hey I just wanted the normal halloween experience why is this candy making me see white things through blocks?

<h1>Different types of Costumes</h1>
There are a total of 4 costumes in this plugin. Each costume gives you a different ability but some even give you 2!
These costumes can be bought from the Costume Shop for costume essence. Different costumes cost different amounts of essence of course.
