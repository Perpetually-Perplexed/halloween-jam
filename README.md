Instructions

Download the jar and the resource pack

Put the resource pack in your folder

It needs optifine to work!

Put the jar in your plugins folder

Do /phone to start your journey!

ProtocolLib is required for this plugin to work

I haven’t tested it’s compatibility with other plugins so preferably only have this plugin+ ProtocolLib while running it

If you find 1 of the million bugs, that sucks for me

About-
