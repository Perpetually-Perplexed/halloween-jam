<h1>How to install!</h1>

Download the jar and the resource pack

Put the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iDfEeIRtJ0ROI2DprFCgdxTPUnPudN4P/view">resource pack</a> in your folder 

It needs optifine to work!

Put the jar in your plugins folder

Do /phone to start your journey!

ProtocolLib is required for this plugin to work

I haven’t tested it’s compatibility with other plugins so preferably only have this plugin+ ProtocolLib while running it

If you find 1 of the million bugs, that sucks for me
