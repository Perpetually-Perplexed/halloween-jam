ProtocolLib is required for this plugin to work

I haven’t tested it’s compatibility with other plugins so preferably only have this plugin+ ProtocolLib while running it

If you find 1 of the million bugs, that sucks for me

<h1>About</h1>
This plugin adds many custom items. Candy from a shady candy shop. Costumes from an even shadier costume shop. 
Hey I just wanted the normal halloween experience why is this candy making me see white things through blocks?

<h1>Different types of Costumes</h1>
There are a total of 4 costumes in this plugin. Each costume gives you a different ability but some even give you 2!
These costumes can be bought from the Costume Shop for costume essence. Different costumes cost different amounts of essence of course.
Here are all the costumes
<h2>Blue Hedgedog Costume</h2>
This costume was sold by a random blue dog in a hedge. It makes you go super fast!
  <h3>Perma Speed 2</h3>
    Gives you speed 2, permanantly
  <h3>Boost</h3>
